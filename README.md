# Flight-Delay-Analysis

🎯I am a beginner data analyst. When doing this training course project, the main thing for me was to use a simple and short code to get the most informative and accurate results. So I did a research and applied here some life hacks to make an easy analysis and predict whether an aircraft will be delayed or cancelled🙂

🏆 The dataset used in this research is the Kaggle competition dataset taken from the 2009 ASA Statistical Computing and Graphics Data Expo and available on: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/giovamata/airlinedelaycauses

Some of input files and output results (usually heavier than 25MB) you can find here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BYXSDH7nrWO0gI-Oxj6g_e1KAHosWhY_
